"[1m[32mchecksync 2.2.3 âœ… ðŸ”—[39m[22m

Checksync uses tags in your files to identify blocks that need to remain
synchronised. It works on any text file as long as it can find the tags.

[1m[32mTag Format[39m[22m

Each tagged block is identified by one or more sync-start tags and a single
sync-end tag.

The sync-start tags take the form:

    [1m[33m<comment> sync-start:<marker_id> <?checksum> <target_file>[39m[22m

The sync-end tags take the form:

    [1m[33m<comment> sync-end:<marker_id>[39m[22m

Each [1m[33mmarker_id[39m[22m can have multiple [1m[33msync-start[39m[22m tags, each with a different
target file, but there must be only one corresponding [1m[33msync-end[39m[22m tag.

Where:

    [1m[33m<comment>[39m[22m       is one of the comment tokens provided by the [1m[33m--comment[39m[22m
                    argument

    [1m[33m<marker_id>[39m[22m     is the unique identifier for this marker

    [1m[33m<checksum>[39m[22m      is the expected checksum of the corresponding block in
                    the target file

    [1m[33m<target_file>[39m[22m   is the path from your package root to the target file
                    with a corresponding sync block with the same [1m[33mmarker_id[39m[22m

[1m[32mUsage[39m[22m

[1m[33mchecksync <arguments> <include_globs>[39m[22m

Where:

    [1m[33m<arguments>[39m[22m       are the arguments you provide (see below)

    [1m[33m<include_globs>[39m[22m   are glob patterns for identifying files to check

[1m[32mArguments[39m[22m

    [1m[33m--comments,-c[39m[22m      A string containing comma-separated tokens that
                       indicate the start of lines where tags appear.
                       Defaults to [1m[33m\\"//,#\\"[39m[22m.

    [1m[33m--dry-run,-n[39m[22m       Ignored unless supplied with [1m[33m--update-tags[39m[22m.

    [1m[33m--help,-h[39m[22m          Outputs this help text.

    [1m[33m--ignore,-i[39m[22m        A string containing comma-separated globs that identify
                       files that should not be checked.

    [1m[33m--ignore-files[39m[22m     A comma-separated list of .gitignore-like files that
                       provide path patterns to be ignored. These will be
                       combined with the [1m[33m--ignore[39m[22m globs.
                       Ignored if [1m[33m--no-ignore-file[39m[22m is present.
                       Defaults to [1m[33m.gitignore[39m[22m.

    [1m[33m--no-ignore-file[39m[22m   When [1m[33mtrue[39m[22m, does not use any ignore file. This is
                       useful when the default value for [1m[33m--ignore-file[39m[22m is not
                       wanted.

    [1m[33m--root-marker,-m[39m[22m   By default, the root directory (used to generate
                       interpret and generate target paths for sync-start
                       tags) for your project is determined by the nearest
                       ancestor directory to the processed files that
                       contains a [1m[33mpackage.json[39m[22m file. If you want to
                       use a different file or directory to identify your
                       root directory, specify that using this argument.
                       For example, [1m[33m--root-marker .gitignore[39m[22m would mean
                       the first ancestor directory containing a
                       [1m[33m.gitignore[39m[22m file.

    [1m[33m--update-tags,-u[39m[22m   Updates tags with incorrect target checksums. This
                       modifies files in place; run with [1m[33m--dry-run[39m[22m to see what
                       files will change without modifying them.

    [1m[33m--verbose[39m[22m          More details will be added to the output when this
                       option is provided. This is useful when determining if
                       provided glob patterns are applying as expected, for
                       example.
