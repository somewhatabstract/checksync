-   Node 20 or higher required. Support for Node 16 and Node 18 is deprecated.

-   Babel, jest, typescript, and various other dependencies have been updated to their latest versions.
-   Security vulnerabilities have been addressed with resolutions (https://github.com/somewhatabstract/checksync/security/dependabot/17, https://github.com/somewhatabstract/checksync/security/dependabot/18)
